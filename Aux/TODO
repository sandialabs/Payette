LIST OF THINGS TO DO IN PAYETTE
===============================

LEGEND
------
* - Very important
# - Not as important

GUI
---

*) Updated documentation
*) Overlay files does not work on Linux - missing lignutils libraries.  Could just be a broken link?
*) Overlay files do not display if ordering of header differs from files already displayed
*) In fact all files have to have identical headers to plot together
*) EOS surface visualization
#) Would be nice to have file names in legend of plots
#) Time slider would be better if it was a slider for whatever the current x-axis is
#) Ability to right click on curve and have it removed from display (or in legend)
#) Be able to move legend around or disable legend
#) Right hand axes
#) Exporting plots

DRIVER
------

#) Integration of Lambda/Alegra/CTH models
#) Simplify and reduce copying to/from DataContainer object.  Perhaps initialize all data
