begin simulation kayenta-ldp-noctps-2
  $ This simulation has the following characteristics:
  $ * The shear modulus was calculated from the bulk modulus of aluminum
  $   and a poisson's ratio of 0.1 .
  $ * The simulation is uniaxial extension.
  $ * The CTPS surface is put at (nearly) infinity.
  $ * The limit surface has been set to mimic the CTPS surface when
  $   CTPS = 1.0e8 (these parameters are only good for uniaxial extension).
  $
  $ In ROOTJ2 vs I1 space, this simulation will approach the limit surface and
  $ the return algorithm should make the stress state approach the I1 tensile
  $ vertex.
