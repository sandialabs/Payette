begin simulation kayenta-ldp-noctps-uxe-2
  $ This simulation has the following characteristics:
  $ * The shear modulus was calculated from the bulk modulus of aluminum
  $   and a poisson's ratio of 0.0 .
  $ * The simulation is uniaxial extension.
  $ * The CTPS surface is put at (nearly) infinity.
  $ * The slope of the Linear Drucker Prager surface is slightly more shallow
  $   (0.27 vs 0.288 in ROOTJ2 vs I1 space) than that of the CTPS surface.
  $
  $ In ROOTJ2 vs I1 space, this simulation will approach the limit surface and
  $ the return algorithm should make the stress state approach the I1
  $ tensile vertex.
