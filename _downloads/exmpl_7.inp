    # This is the main optimization block. We specify every available option
    # showing its default value in brackets, along with other available

    # the optimization methods are from scipy.optimize module.

    # below we specify which parameters to optimize with optional upper and
    # lower bounds some methods do not accept bounds, but we have implemented
    # a penalty method to force the bounds to be respected outside of the
    # optimizer. For elastic moduli, bounds really should be used so the the
    # optimizer does not send in invalid moduli that woudl crash the
    # simulation. the initial value must also be specified. initial value and
    # lower/upper bounds can be specified in any order.
