"""This is the docstring for the Payette_docexmpl.py module. It was lifted
directly form numpy's doc/example.py and modified slightly for the Payette
naming scheme. Modules names should follow the convention:
Payette_module_name.py. module_name should be a short, all-lowercase names.
The modulue_name may have underscores if this improves readability.

Every module should have a docstring at the very top of the file.  The
module's docstring may extend over multiple lines.  If your docstring does
extend over multiple lines, the closing three quotation marks must be on
a line by itself, preferably preceeded by a blank line.

import os # standard library imports first

# Do NOT import using *, e.g. from numpy import *
#
# Import the module using
#
#   import numpy
#
# instead or import individual functions as needed, e.g
#
#  from numpy import array, zeros
#
# If you prefer the use of abbreviated module names, we suggest the
# convention used by NumPy itself::

import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# These abbreviated names are not to be used in docstrings; users must
# be able to paste and execute docstrings after importing only the
# numpy module itself, unabbreviated.

def foo(var1, var2, long_var_name='hi') :
    r"""A one-line summary that does not use variable names or the
    function name.

    Several sentences providing an extended description. Refer to
    variables using back-ticks, e.g. `var`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    var1 : array_like
        Array_like means all those objects -- lists, nested lists, etc. --
        that can be converted to an array.  We can also refer to
        variables like `var1`.
    var2 : int
        The type above can either refer to an actual Python type
        (e.g. ``int``), or describe the type of the variable in more
        detail, e.g. ``(N,) ndarray`` or ``array_like``.
    Long_variable_name : {'hi', 'ho'}, optional
        Choices in brackets, default first when optional.

    Returns
    -------
    describe : type
        Explanation
    output : type
        Explanation
    tuple : type
        Explanation
    items : type
        even more explaining

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    only_seldom_used_keywords : type
        Explanation
    common_parameters_listed_above : type
        Explanation

    Raises
    ------
    BadException
        Because you shouldn't have done that.

    See Also
    --------
    otherfunc : relationship (optional)
    newfunc : Relationship (optional), which could be fairly long, in which
              case the line wraps here.
    thirdfunc, fourthfunc, fifthfunc

    Notes
    -----
    Notes about the implementation algorithm (if needed).

    This can have multiple paragraphs.

    You may include some math:

    .. math:: X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}

    And even use a greek symbol like :math:`omega` inline.

    References
    ----------
    Cite the relevant literature, e.g. [1]_.  You may also cite these
    references in the notes section above.

       expert systems and adaptive co-kriging for environmental habitat

       and neural-network techniques," Computers & Geosciences, vol. 22,
       pp. 585-588, 1996.

    Examples
    --------
    These are written in doctest format, and should illustrate how to
    use the function.

    >>> a=[1,2,3]
    >>> print [x + 3 for x in a]
    [4, 5, 6]
    >>> print "a\n\nb"
    a
