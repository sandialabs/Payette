    # This is the main optimization block. We specify every available option
    # showing its default value in brackets, along with other available
    # options in braces, if applicable.

    # Below, we specify the optimization method and options. Thus far, all of
    # the optimization methods are form scipy.optimize module.
    method simplex  # downhill simplex algorithm [simplex] <simplex, powell>
    maxiter 25  # maximum number of iterations [25]
    tolerance 1.e-4  # tolerance between out and gold file [1.e-4]

    # below we specify which parameters to optimize. The ubound and lbound are
    # optional. In fact, they are not yet implemented but we leave them as a
    # reminder to implement the feature!
    optimize K, ubound 150.e9, lbound 125.e9  # parameter to optimize
    optimize G, ubound 57.e9, lbound 45.e9  # parameter to optimize

    # below we specify the "gold file" that has the results against which we
    # compare the output from the simulation, along with the minimizing
    # variables from that file. The optimization algorithm optimizes the
    # parameters specified above by minimizing the difference between the
    # minimizing variables in the gold file and the simulation output file.
