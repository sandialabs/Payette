  # is a bit contrived, but if a file has several simulations, all with the
  # same material, or boundary, for example, being able to insert a block from
  # elsewhere in the file is useful.

# below is the named "material_001" block. It could have been named anything.
# It must be outside of any other block. The input parser will find it and
