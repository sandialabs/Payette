# Example 2
# Title: exmpl_2
# Author: Tim Fuller, tjfulle@sandia.gov
# Keywords: table, insert, strain control
# Comments: This example is the same as exmpl_1, but we read in the strains
#           from an external file and tell Payette which columns to find the
#           strain.

  begin boundary
    kappa = 0
    tstar = 1.
    ampl = 1

    begin legs

      # In exmpl_1 the syntax for reading data from a table was introduced.
      # Repeated here:

      #       using <dt, time>, <deformation type>, [from columns ...]

      # In this example, we use the keyword "insert" to insert an external
      # file. In this case, the external file has the deformation table.
      # Actually, the table is the result file from exmpl_0. It is convenient
      # to insert the table rather than have to write it out in the input
      # file. To use the table, we must tell Payette in which columns to find
      # the components of strain with the [from columns ...] option. In the
      # [from columns ...] option we first tell Payette the column number of
      # the <time, dt> specifier and then the columns of the deformation type.
      # To specify a time/strain table where time is in column 1 and the
      # components of the strain in columns 3 - 8, the following forms are all
      # equivalent:

      #       using time, strain, from columns 1, 3:8
      #       using time, strain, from columns 1, 3 : 8
      #       using time, strain, from columns 1, 3-8
      #       using time, strain, from columns 1, 3 - 8
      #       using time, strain, from columns 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

      # This syntax allows driving Payette, for example, by an experimental
      # data file where the <dt, time>, <deformation type> columns may not be
      # ordered using the same ordering scheme in Payette.

      using time, strain, from columns 1, 3:8
      insert exmpls.tbl
