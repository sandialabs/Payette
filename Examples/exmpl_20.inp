# Example 20
# Title: exmpl_20
# Author: Scot Swan, mswan@sandia.gov
# Keywords: eos, ideal gas, surface, isotherm, hugoniot
# Comments: In this example, the ideal gas EOS is used to produce
#           a surface and trajectory of the EOS surface.
#
#
# The IdealGas EOS is driven, like other EOS'es, primarily
# by density, but is assumed to be driving 1 mole of particles.
# Density is found under the assumption of:
#           Volume_0 * rho_0 = Molar mass
# with Volume_0 being found by:
#           Volume_0 = R * T / P
# with
#   R = Gas constant (8.3144621 Joule / K / mole)
#   T = standard temperature ( 293.15 K )
#   P = Standard pressure  (101.325 Kpa )

    # The EOS driver requires that all the inputs (in both the material
    # and the boundary blocks) be of the same unit system AND that it be
    # explicitly defined. Because the matlabel XML file for ideal gas is
    # done in MKSK, those are the input units. We need to also explicitly
    # set the output units.
